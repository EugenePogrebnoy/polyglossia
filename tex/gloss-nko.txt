"I suppose the days and the years are supposed to be displayed in Arabic numbers?"
No, it is not the case. N'ko numbers :
0 ߀
1 ߁
2 ߂
3 ߃
4 ߄
5 ߅
6 ߆
7 ߇
8 ߈
9 ߉
In n'ko, this is an example of date :
߂߀߁߃ ߞߏ߲ߞߏߜߍ ߕߟߋ߬ ߁߈ (RTL)
( 18 February 2013 )
The word "ߕߟߋ߬" is mandatory between month name and day number.

"I’ll need the names of the twelve months too" ... "here is the list in English:"
I will send you as soon as possible the complete translated list.

Hi Arthur
Here are the list of words you need. However, I did not translate "encl" because I need more explanations.
